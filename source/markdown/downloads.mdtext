The latest stable release of Apache Traffic Server is v10.0.1, released on 2024-10-29.
In addition, we continue to support the v9.2.x LTS release train, currently v9.2.5,
which was released on 2024-07-25. We follow the [Semantic Versioning](http://semver.org)
scheme. The goal is to release patch releases frequently, and minor releases as needed.
Within the major versions, all such patch and minor releases are all compatible.

When downloading from a mirror, please be sure to [verify the hash and OpenPGP
compatible signature](https://www.apache.org/info/verification.html).  To validate
the PGP signatures the [public keys from the release manager](https://www.apache.org/dist/trafficserver/KEYS)
will be needed.  You can also
[browse through all releases](https://archive.apache.org/dist/trafficserver/)
and hash signatures.
